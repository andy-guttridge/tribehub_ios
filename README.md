# TribeHub iOS

A native iOS app for the TribeHub family organiser, built using Swift and UIKit.

## Future improvements and features
### High priority

- It was not possible to fully implement username and password autofill on the login view, due to requiring a paid Apple developer account to be able to use ['Associated Domains'](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/supporting-associated-domains). This would be a priority feature for a commerical version of the app.
- It is not currently possible to edit or delete a calendar event from the search results view, because Apple's searchController API presents a searchResultsController modally, which means the Edit button navigationItem is not shown. Implementing this feature would require some additional customisation of the search functionality, which was not possible due to time restrictions, but would be prioritised for a commercial version of the app.
- Account registration
- Notifications
